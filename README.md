# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust!

I'm using Rust for Advent of Code 2022 because I want to learn the language and I think solving problems is a good way to get exposure to a range of language features.  I also wanted to explore the testing features of rust/cargo, so I've structured the project as a library crate with a module for each day.  The modules have unit tests to verify basic functionality, and the actual solutions are implemented as integration tests.
